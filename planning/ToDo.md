# To Do First

- [] Loading state for new comments could be improved. Currently if two comments are entered in quick succession they are briefly assigned the same value.

# To Do Later

- [] Add a Post review button in the Reviews List page
- [] Improve lazy loading component in App.jsx from just Loading... to the loading image.
- [] Review the "first comment" flow as it appears to not post the comment body
- [] Categories page: users can add a new category if it doesn't exist
- [] Reviews List: users can delete a review (if they own it)
- [] Users page: create a login/logout function - no passwords as authentication not yet built
